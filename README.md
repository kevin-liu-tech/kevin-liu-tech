- 👋 Welcome to my sanctum sanctorum. My name is Kevin. I’m currently a 18 y/o author at Georgetown University's New Degree Press, the Founder of Kevin Eleven Media and Alumnus of The Knowledge Society. I'm also the Executive Director at the Earthshot Research Institute, a Canadian non-profit dedicated to identifying and solving the world's biggest problems for the bottom billion.
- 🦄 I like to help magical people make even more magic and do more interesting things. I've previously interned at Interac, MetaVRse, Actionable, Take Back Perfect w/ Clay Hebert doing various tasks from copywriting, (digital) strategy, partnerships, ecosystem research, machine learning model development, UI/UX, and QA.
- 🌱 Over the past 2 years, Kevin has also led/worked on consulting recommendation deck projects with organizations like the United Nations, Shell, BenchSci, and Instacart.
- 📝 I’m currently creating a playbook on how to solve the world's biggest problems, what exactly they are, and why they're important.
